# Willow's Website 2

This is a website I made. It's based on my experimental webserver, wwebs. Content on this website is written in Markdown.

This website is designed to be compatible with the following means of access:  
* Graphical web browser
* Text-based web browser
* Web browser instrumented with a screen reader
* Gemini client
* RSS newsreader
* RSS podcast reader (video pages are read out loud, otherwise the mimic 3 engine is used to read content.)
