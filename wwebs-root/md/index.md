# Willow's Website

Welcome to my website! I make posts here every once in a while.

You can use [/html/tree](/html/tree), [/gem/tree](/gem/tree), [/md/tree](/md/tree), and [/txt/tree](/txt/tree) to see a tree view of all pages for each content section. If you want to only see a subset of pages, you can add a path stub after the tree page, like `/html/tree/hello/world`. You can also use [/feed.ts](/feed.ts) to generate an RSS feed of new pages in chronological order, using path stubs in the same way to filter content.
